API:
Application Programming Interface
APIs can be built with python just like Apps
These are meant to be read by other apps.
Usually these are in JSON
Which means that API can be read like JSON.
So for example to display news, you can read an API, store it and display it on the webapp.
REST is one type of API

You can download files and pull websites as well from request library's get method

Use debugger to see the contents of the API and plan your access accordingly
